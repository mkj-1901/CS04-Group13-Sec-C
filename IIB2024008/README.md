# SQL Injection Demo – Authentication Bypass Lab

⚠️ **Educational use only.** This application is intentionally vulnerable and must never be deployed on a public network. It is designed for a university Cyber Security assignment to demonstrate and then fix an **SQL Injection Authentication Bypass** vulnerability.

## 🚀 Installation & Running

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd IIB2024008
npm install
```

### Repository Setup

The repository includes a `.gitignore` file to exclude generated files and dependencies from version control, such as:

- `node_modules/`
- `data/*.db` (SQLite database files)
- IDE folders (`.idea/`, `.vscode/`)
- Log files (`npm-debug.log`, `yarn-debug.log`, `yarn-error.log`)

This helps keep the repository clean and avoids committing large, unnecessary files.

### 2. Run in Secure mode (default)

```bash
npm start
# → http://localhost:3000 (SECURE mode)
```

### 3. Run in Vulnerable mode

```bash
npm run start:vulnerable
# → http://localhost:3000 (VULNERABLE mode)
```

The SQLite database is created automatically in `data/users.db` on first startup — no manual setup is needed.

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Demo

### A. Vulnerable Mode

1. Start the server in vulnerable mode:
   ```bash
   npm run start:vulnerable
   ```
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
3. Try logging in with valid credentials — e.g. `alice` / `password456` — to confirm normal login works.
4. Now log out and enter the following **SQL injection payload** as the username:
   ```
   ' OR '1'='1' --
   ```
   Enter anything (or nothing) as the password.
5. You are logged in as **admin** — without knowing the password! The injected SQL makes the `WHERE` clause always true and comments out the password check.
6. Check the server terminal — you'll see the raw query that was executed, confirming the injection.

### B. Secure Mode

1. Stop the server. Restart it in secure mode:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser. Note the **🔒 MODE: SECURE** banner.
3. Try the same injection payload (`' OR '1'='1' --`) as the username.
4. Login is **rejected** — the payload is treated as a literal string, not SQL syntax. No matching user is found.
5. Log in with valid credentials (`alice` / `password456`) — it works as expected.

## 👤 Demo Users (seeded automatically)

| Username | Password      | Role  |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| admin    | admin123      | admin |
| alice    | password456   | user  |
| bob      | secret789     | user  |
| krish    | krish@008     | user  |

## 🔍 Root Cause

The vulnerable route **concatenates raw user input directly into the SQL query string**:

```js
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'`;
```

An attacker enters `' OR '1'='1' --` as the username, which transforms the query into:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' --' AND password = '...'
```

The `OR '1'='1'` makes the `WHERE` clause always true, and `--` comments out the password check — granting access as the first user (admin) without knowing the password.

## 🛡️ Mitigations Implemented

| Defence | How it works in this demo |
|---------|--------------------------|
| **Parameterized Queries** | The secure route uses `db.prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?').get(username, password)`. The `?` placeholders ensure user input is always treated as *data*, never as SQL syntax. |
| **Input Validation** | Username length is capped at 64 characters and password at 128 characters, rejecting excessively long inputs before they reach the database. |
| **Error Handling** | Internal database errors are caught and logged server-side; only a generic error message is returned to the client, preventing information leakage. |

### Other Mitigations (Theory)

- **Stored Procedures:** Moving SQL logic into stored procedures on the database server limits what an application can execute, reducing the attack surface for injection.
- **Least Privilege:** The database user account used by the application should have only the minimum permissions required (e.g., `SELECT` on the users table), so even a successful injection cannot `DROP TABLE` or access other data.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can detect and block common injection patterns (`' OR`, `UNION SELECT`, `--`, etc.) at the network layer before they reach the application. However, WAFs can be bypassed and should not be the sole defence.
- **Hashed Passwords:** In a production system, passwords should be stored as salted hashes (e.g., bcrypt). Even if an attacker extracts data via injection, they cannot recover plaintext passwords.

## ⚠️ Security Warning

- Never expose the vulnerable route on a public network.
- Never test against systems you do not own.
- The server binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) only.
- Fixing SQL injection does **not** make an application fully secure — authentication should also use hashed passwords, HTTPS, rate-limiting, and session management in a production system.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `better-sqlite3` build fails | Install the C++ build tools: `npm install -g windows-build-tools` or install Visual Studio Build Tools with the **Desktop development with C++** workload. |
| Port 3000 in use | Set a different port: `set PORT=4000&& node server.js` |
| Database locked | Delete `data/users.db` and restart — it will be re-created. |
